All of your data, including book library metadata and loan information, is stored on your own Google Drive (or organisation shared drive).

This means, if you choose to cancel your subscription, you will __retain__ all of your loans data. As this data is solely owned and controlled by you.

All our software is [__open-source__](https://github.com/shelf-dog){:target="_blank"}, so you can choose to run it yourself if you prefer (although no support is provided for this).
