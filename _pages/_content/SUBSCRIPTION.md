To enable use to offer the most __cost-effective pricing__{:.text-white}, all subscriptions are offered on a __yearly__{:.bg-warning .text-body .px-1 .rounded-lg} basis. As an organisation, you can choose to subscribe on a __monthly__{:.bg-info .text-body .px-1 .rounded-lg} if that suits your needs better.

All payments are handled securely through Stripe, and all major payment cards as accepted. You can cancel your subscription at any time, although we do not offer refunds for unused periods of service (e.g. if you cancel early) although you can continue to use the service until the end of your billed period.
