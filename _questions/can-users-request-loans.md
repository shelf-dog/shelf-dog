__Yes__{:.text-white .bg-dark .p-1 .font-larger-110 .mr-1} If you want to operate a queuing or click and collect service, then you can allow your users to request loans. Just tick the 'Can requests be made for loans with this Library' option on your library settings page. Requests will show up on your management page and can quickly be converted to a loan.
