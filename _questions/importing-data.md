question: Can I Import my existing Library Data?

If you already have your library in Calibre, you don't need to do anything! Just open your library settings and point it towards your Calibre database (normally named __metadata.db__{:.text-white .font-weight-normal} and found in the root of your Calibre Library folder) and your Calibre library folder. That's it, everything should now be online and accessible.

If you have data in an alternate format or system, we are always happy to offer advice and support on the best way to convert it (we have done lots of conversion ourselves!). If you would like us to convert it for you, we can normally quote for this service - but the cost and time required will be dependent on how much data you have and what sort of format it is currently in. Please [get in touch](mailto:hello@shelf.dog?subject=Data Transfer Quote){:.text-highlight-mid .link-jump target="_blank" rel="noopener"} with us to kick off a conversation about how we can best help!
