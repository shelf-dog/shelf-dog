Subscribing is quick and easy. Head over to our [pricing](/pricing/){:.text-highlight-mid .link-jump} page and choose your subscription tier. Then you will need to fill in a few quick details (name of your library, and your domain if you are subscribing as an organisation). Payments are by card and handled by [Stripe](https://stripe.com){:.text-highlight-mid .link-jump target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. As soon as your payment has been processed, you will receive an email with a link to create your Library Loan sheet, and activate your library. If you already have a Calibre library set up, you can be up and running in just a few minutes!
