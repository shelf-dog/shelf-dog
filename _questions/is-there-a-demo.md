__Yes__{:.text-white .bg-dark .p-1 .font-larger-110 .mr-1} You can try out the web-app with our simple [demo library](/app/?demo){:.text-highlight-mid .link-jump}. This is a fully features library, with the ability to both explore and manage the library (loan and return books etc.). In normal usage, library management is a privilege that you can assign to a subset of your users, so they those pages & buttons would not be visible for most people. The loans, requests and returns that you record in this demo are only visible to the user that created them, and will reset back to nothing after about an hour.
