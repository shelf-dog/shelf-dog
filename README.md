The __Shelf Dog__{:.text-white .font-weight-normal} library system comprises three main components:

### Library Web App
{:.text-highlight .font-weight-bold}

This allows library users to __search for__{:.text-white .font-weight-normal}, and __view details__{:.text-white .font-weight-normal} about, books held within the library. Searching and navigation is all conducted within the web browser, so it is __incredibly fast__{:.text-white .font-weight-normal} and __easy__{:.text-white .font-weight-normal} to explore the collection!

For lending libraries, loans can be requested by users directly and license free ebooks (EPUB format) can also be __read online__{:.text-white .font-weight-normal} if the library is configured to allow it!

### Management Tools
{:.text-highlight .font-weight-bold}

This is where the __magic happens__{:.text-white .font-weight-normal}. You can manage __loans__{:.text-white .font-weight-normal}, __returns__{:.text-white .font-weight-normal} and __requests__{:.text-white .font-weight-normal} in the web-browser. All the loan data is in a simple Google Sheet stored in your My Drive or a Shared Drive if you prefer. This spreadsheet acts as a simple database, but can also do so much more. You can __filter__{:.text-white .font-weight-normal} and __analyse__{:.text-white .font-weight-normal} your own data, and we have included functionality to allow emailing out of overdue notices to your users or other interested parties (e.g. Class Teachers).

### Book Catalog
{:.text-highlight .font-weight-bold}

Behind the scenes is the catalog of all your books. To keep things as open as possible, we read information about the books from a Calibre Library database. This means you can use the excellent [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/){:.text-highlight-mid .link-jump target="_blank" rel="noopener"} to manage your library.

If you have an existing Calibre library, you can __definitely use this__{:.text-white .font-weight-normal} - provided it is (or can be) stored in Google Drive! We don't need anything special, although we do support a few special configuration options for [custom columns]({% link _tutorials/custom-column-formats.md %}){:.text-highlight-mid .link-jump}. If you want to find out more about running your existing library in the cloud, have a look at our [tutorials]({% link _tutorials/using-an-existing-library.md %}){:.text-highlight-mid .link-jump}. Finally, if you want to see how you can migrate existing metadata about the books in your library into a Calibre database, we have got you [covered]({% link _tutorials/migrating-your-catalog.md %}){:.text-highlight-mid .link-jump}.
